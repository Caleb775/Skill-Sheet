                  My 3D solar system project is an interactive simulation that shows planets orbiting 
                  the Sun. Made with Three.js, it features a realistic starry background and lighting effects. 
                  The Sun glows brightly at the center, while Earth and Mars move smoothly along their paths. 
                  Users can switch between different camera viewsâ€”overhead (press A), Earth (Press E), and Mars (Press P) to explore the solar system from various angles.

                  My avatar project has a customizable 3D character that can perform movements like 
                  walking, turning, cartwheeling, and flipping, all controlled by the keyboard. I Built it with Three.js, 
                  the character is made up of geometric shapes for its body and face. It includes collision detection to prevent passing through obstacles, 
                  allowing for realistic interactions. This Project was so cool to make. You use the arrow keys to move and press 
                  D to cartwheel and F to flip.</p>
