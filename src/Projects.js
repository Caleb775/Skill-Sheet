                  My 3D solar system project is an interactive simulation that shows planets orbiting
                  the Sun. Made with Three.js, it features a realistic starry background and lighting effects.
                  The Sun glows brightly at the center, while Earth and Mars move smoothly along their paths.
                  Users can switch between different camera viewsâ€”overhead (press A), Earth (Press E), and Mars (Press P) to explore the solar system from various angles.

                  walking, turning, cartwheeling, and flipping, all controlled by the keyboard. I built it with Three.js,
                  the character is made up of geometric shapes for its body and face. It includes collision detection to prevent passing through obstacles,
                  allowing for realistic interactions. You use the arrow keys to move and press D to cartwheel and F to flip.

                  We combined that with the local weather and famous quotes to help people leave their house a little bit happier.
                  Weather-Cats is an easy-to-use, straightforward application that delivers data to the user in a format that they can view simply whether
                  they are on a desktop or using their smartphone.
