This Modual called for a password to be generated randomly 
With starter code the script.js file had a function call generatePassword
that wasnt being defined and so it wasnt generating any passwords when the generate button was pushed.
Using two promts the first prompt was answered 
choosing a number between 8 and 128. 
The second prompt was called when user chose and number less than 8 and more
than 128.
If no value was put in then there was an alert that said "This needs a value".
Below the prompts and if/else if statement there is loop for the "password" variable that
can be done to infinitly generate passwords. this loop only worked for two loops 
and I had no idea why but now it works properly.

I first started using input elements inside my html file with the ability to check box the
password criteria but that created an issue where i was unable to get the prompt to work
properly so i trashed it completley

There is nothing listed in the console.log
if a length is choosen put no other criteria is choosen then there is an error that i dont
know why occurs.
